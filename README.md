# Graph embedding convolutional network

Demonstration of implementing a fully parallelisable message passing graph convolutional network.
The Python files within this repository are Jupyter notebooks that can be opened with the [Jupytext extension](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext).

## Creating training data

The notebook is designed to created training data from graph benchmark datasets downloaded from the TU Dortmund [Benchmark Data Sets for Graph Kernels](https://ls11-www.cs.tu-dortmund.de/staff/morris/graphkerneldatasets).
