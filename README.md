# Graph embedding convolutional network

Demonstration of implementing a fully parallelisable message passing graph convolutional network.

## Creating training data

The notebook is designed to created training data from graph benchmark datasets downloaded from the TU Dortmund [Benchmark Data Sets for Graph Kernels](https://ls11-www.cs.tu-dortmund.de/staff/morris/graphkerneldatasets).
